# ofxNDI

NewTek NDI SDK Wrapper for openFrameworks.

Works on Mac, iOS, Linux, and Windows.

For Linux users, please follow this Issue.  
https://github.com/nariakiiwatani/ofxNDI/issues/27

__I stopped to provide iOS lib because it is so big that significantly consume my GitHub storage.  
please download it from NewTek.__

## Warning
- This addon is trying to wrap all features of original SDK, but some of them are not tested.
- Receivers on mobile OS won't work because they are not supported by SDK currently.
